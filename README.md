## **<ins>Introduction</ins>**
This is my milestone 2 project for the Fullstack Web Developer with the Codeinistitute. The porject is not complete 
due time constraints and the need to deploy the final version earlier than expected. I was working towards a date of the 
14th of March on the Schedule Generator but the due date is the 05th of Febuary. None the less the site is functional and 
has 90% of the functions and layout. There was some more, I would have added to the project, I will outline the other elements
that I would have added in the [Future Enhancements](#Future_Enhancements) sections of this document. 

## **<ins>Project_Motivation</ins>**
The main objective of this site is to provide a holiday planner for sites in Ireland, as part of the design process I wanted to make it easy to 
add new or remove existing detinations. To achive this simplification, all the destination location is contained in one file that is loaded to the site
when it loads. The menu selections for populating the map are dynamic and only populated with data based on locations included and based on user selection.
